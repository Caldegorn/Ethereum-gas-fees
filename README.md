Estimate Ethereum Gas Fees using Python.

## Overview

This repository provides a simple Python script to estimate gas fees on the Ethereum network. It leverages the `web3.py` library and/or external APIs to fetch current gas prices and calculate approximate transaction costs.

## Features

- Fetch current base and priority gas fees (EIP-1559 compatible)
- Estimate gas limit for transactions
- Calculate approximate gas cost in ETH
- Support for querying popular gas price APIs (optional)
- Easy to integrate into Python projects or scripts

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Access to an Ethereum node RPC endpoint (e.g., Infura, Alchemy)
- Optional: API keys for external gas price services (e.g., Etherscan)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Caldegorn/Ethereum-gas-fees.git
cd Ethereum-gas-fees
```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(If `requirements.txt` is not included, install manually:)*

```
pip install web3 requests
```

## Usage

Edit `fees.py` to configure your Ethereum RPC endpoint and transaction parameters.

Run the script:

```
python fees.py
```

The script will output:

- Current base fee per gas (in Gwei)
- Suggested priority fee (miner tip)
- Estimated gas limit for the example transaction
- Approximate total gas cost in ETH

## Example Output

```
Connected to Ethereum node
Base fee per gas: 45.3 Gwei
Priority fee: 2 Gwei
Estimated gas limit: 21000
Approximate gas cost: 0.00101 ETH
```

## Customization

- Modify the transaction dictionary in `fees.py` to estimate gas for different transaction types.
- Adjust priority fee based on network conditions.
- Integrate with other Ethereum tools or wallets.
